// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "Addresses the requirements, function, purpose, and expectations of the product to be developed. Developers would analyze and document these specifications."
const design = "Developers define the architecture of the software system and determine the hardwware requirements."
const implementation = "Using what was determined in the previous step, developers work on units, or small programs that work together to form the entire system. Includes testing each unit, portion of code, to make sure they work."
const testingAndIntegration = "Combine the different units into a single system, and test them for any bugs and erros."
const Maintain = "Developers address any problems that become known during the use of the software after sales, or open to the public. They provide support in terms of patches and troubleshooting."
